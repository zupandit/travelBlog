        description:`Bungus Valley is lush green meadow hidden inside the mountains of Kashmir 
        at about 3000m above sea level. It is about 100kms away from Srinagar (Capital of Kashmir). Honestly, 
        it looks like a piece of heaven that fell down to earth.`

        scenery is breathtaking. The drive up is super dangerous. You can find snow even in June up there. But

        Absolutely stunning scenes. When we reached the summit were quickly humbled by a new mother carrying 
        her child (on her back) as she trekked down. 10/10. More on the easier side. Thank you to the Quebecers
        who bandaged my foot!
